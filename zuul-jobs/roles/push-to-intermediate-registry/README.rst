Push artifacts to the intermediate registry

This role will push any images built by
:zuul:role:`build-docker-image` or :zuul:role:`build-container-image`
into an intermediate registry.

Run this in a trusted post-playbook at the end of a job after the
image build.

This requires the :zuul:role:`run-buildset-registry` role already
applied.  It also requires an externally managed "intermediate"
registry operating for the use of Zuul, and it requires "skopeo" and
"socat" to be installed on the Zuul executors.
