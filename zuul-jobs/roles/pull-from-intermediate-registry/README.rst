Pull artifacts from the intermediate registry

This role will pull any artifacts built for changes ahead of this
change which have been placed in an intermediate registry into the
buildset registry for this buildset.

Run this in a trusted pre-playbook at the start of a job (which, in
the case of multiple dependent jobs in a buildset, should be at the
root of the job dependency graph).

This requires the :zuul:role:`run-buildset-registry` role already
applied.  It also requires an externally managed "intermediate"
registry operating for the use of Zuul, and it requires "skopeo" and
"socat" to be installed on the Zuul executors.
