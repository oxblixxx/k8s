- job:
    name: build-diskimage
    description: |
      Build an image using diskimage-builder

      Note that this job does not perform any actions with the image
      after building it.  In particular, due to the typical sizes of
      diskimages, it does not move the image artifact to the executor
      or prepare it to be uploaded to log storage.

         :type: dict

         supplied using this variable (or by directly using the Ansible

         The path where the log output of the diskimage-builder shall be written to

      .. zuul:jobvar:: build_diskimage_retry_limit
