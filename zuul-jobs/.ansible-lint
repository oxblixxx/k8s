  # NOTE(ianw) After following the jinja formatting extensions in
  # ansible-lint for a few releases, this does not seem to be
  # appropriate for us.  It has broken in a couple of releases [1,2]
  # -- but more importantly as discussed in [1] this is a bit
  # opinonated in ways we may not like; for example
  #  varibale|int > 123
  # I would argue is clearer than
  #  variable | int > 123
  # which it tries to enforce.  This is a bit unfortunate because it
  # does pick up some other things were people have clearly forgotten
  # spaces around variables, etc.  Let's leave it up to humans to
  # decide on good jinja here.
