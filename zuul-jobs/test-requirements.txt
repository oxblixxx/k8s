# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, which may cause wedges in the gate later.

# We need to pin the ansible version directly here; per the
# deprecation policy it should trail the lowest version used by Zuul
# by 4 weeks to give people time to update before any roles start
# depending on new features.

# Some older versions of Ansible don't support older versions of
# python we have on older test nodes, so do the best we can in those
# cases.
